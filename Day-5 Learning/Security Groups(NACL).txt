Security Groups- It serves at instance level. AWS will assign a default Security Groups while creating ec2 instance. Securiy Groups is only for allowing no denial.
a. Default Security Group- will allow all the outbound traffic except for port 25. Does not allow on port 25 b'coz it is a mailing service and they want any type of spam activity and does not want to record the ip
address of ec2 instance so it blocks the outbound traffic on port 25 by default.
b. And aws will deny all the inbound traffic coming into instance.

1. Inbound traffic- Traffic coming into ec2 instance. for ex : User trying to access application inside the ec2 instance.
2. Outbound traffic- Traffic going out of the ec2 instance. for ex: Application inside ec2 trying to access something outside the ec2 instance.

NACL(Network Access Control List) - It is applied at subnet level.Act as an additional layer of security. We can deny and allow the traffic we want to have access.
1. Using nacl devops engineer can define there organizations network traffic.
2. If something is applied at subnet level then it is applied to all the instances within the subnet.
3. for ex-a. There are 50 ec2 instances inside the subnet so using nacl we can define the nacl configuration to all the ec2 instances.
          b. Using this we can automate the work of assinging the rules at each ec2 instance instead we can use nacl. 

Practical Implementation
Using this command python3 -m http.server 8000
we can use python3 running on port 8080 for this we will create a inbound and outbound traffic rules.
