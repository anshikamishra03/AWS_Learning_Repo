IAM Service (Identity and Access Management) – IAM is a service on AWS that provides authentication and authorization.

Users / Policies –

1. As a DevOps engineer, when someone joins the organization and requests access to AWS, you will first ask which services they need access to.

2. Then, you will create a user for that person (e.g., xyz) and attach policies that define what actions they are allowed to perform on specific services.

1. Users – Used for authentication (verifying identity).

2. Policies – Used for authorization (defining what actions are allowed).

User Groups –

1. Groups help solve the problem of managing users and policies efficiently, especially when many people join or leave the organization.

2. They reduce manual work and improve efficiency in assigning access.

3. First, we categorize people in the organization based on their roles and the access they might need on AWS—for example, dev, QA, DB admin, or others.

4. According to the group they belong to, we create a user and place them in the appropriate group.

Roles –

1. A role is a temporary identity that gives permission to someone (a user or a service) to access AWS resources.

2. It is safer than sharing usernames and passwords.
Example: If an EC2 instance needs to access an S3 bucket, you can assign a role to the EC2 instance that allows it to access S3—this avoids the need to 
store secret access keys inside your code.
