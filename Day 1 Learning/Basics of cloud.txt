What is Cloud?
Cloud is a network of remote servers used to store, process data, and run applications.

Virtualization
Virtualization helps solve the problem of resource wastage on a server. It is the process of creating logical isolation over a physical server.

Types of Cloud Network

1. Private Cloud – You or your organization manages and maintains the entire cloud platform.

2. Public Cloud – Cloud providers like Amazon, Microsoft, Google, etc., manage and maintain the entire ecosystem. We can request access to the resources, 
and all those resources are managed by these cloud providers.

Why Public Cloud?

1. Managing your own private cloud is more costly.

2. There's a maintenance overhead when managing everything yourself.

3. Recommended for startups and mid-scale organizations.

4. Public cloud providers offer a wide range of high-quality services.

Why is AWS popular?

1. It was the first entrant in the cloud platform market.

2. The number of services offered has increased over time.

Disadvantages of Cloud Platforms

1. Cloud repatriation – Moving from the cloud to on-premises data centers (private cloud); very few organizations do this.

2. Due to the cost of cloud platforms.

3. Security concerns.
