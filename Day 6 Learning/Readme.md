Route 53 – Route 53 on AWS provides DNS (Domain Name System) as a service.

It is a DNS service that maps the domain name with the IP address of the Load Balancer.

Configure Route 53 on AWS
a. Domain Registration – Purchase domain names either on AWS or from other platforms.
b. If you buy the domain name from other providers, you have to store it in a Hosted Zone (it creates the DNS records according to the domain names and IP addresses).
c. Health Checks – It performs checks on web servers to verify whether they are active or not.
